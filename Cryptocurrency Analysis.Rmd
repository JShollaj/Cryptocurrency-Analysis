In this short document, we aim to perform basic data manipulations of the 
main cryptocurrencies in the market using the R language to cleanse the data
so it can be later on transformed into into meaningful findings for the user. 
As a step by step guide, the user is 
free to follow the examples with the code given as well as modify it for his own
personal preferences.


Stage 1 - Accessing and Importing the Data

In order to have access to the cryptocurrencies available, we have API's which
make the job considerably easier.
There are several choices from which you can derive the data from, for example
you can use the Coinbase API database of crypto by utilizing the following code:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())  # reset global variables
#import the libraries we need
library(jsonlite)
library(glue)
```

(Note: for any packages missing on your behalf, you can use the sample code of
package.install('name') to be able to obtain access to it later on. 

After importing the libraries, we retrieve the data from the available JSON 
database of Coinbase, and we assign the column names to each pair in the file
and then write it to a csv file.

```{r}
# create a function to retrieve daily data
retreive_daily_data <- function(pair, filename) {
  url = glue("https://api.pro.coinbase.com/products/{pair}/candles?granularity=86400")
  columnNames <- c('unix', 'low', 'high', 'open', 'close', glue('{pair} volume'))
  mydata <- fromJSON(url) #retrieve the data from the JSON url
  df <- as.data.frame(mydata) #define the dataframe for the assigned values
  colnames(df) <- columnNames  # rename the columns
  
  write.csv(df, file = filename)
}
```

Next, we want to access the file locally as a csv file. For our example, we have 
chosen ADA (or Cardano) which is a public blockchain platform. It is open source
and decentralized, with high expectations in the crypto market.

```{r}
newPair <- "ADA-USD"
fileName <- glue("dailyData{newPair}.csv")  #Assigning the name for each value
runFunc <- retreive_daily_data(newPair, filename = fileName)
runFunc
```

By now you can see the file in your local system in the csv format. This is how
it should look like, under the name dailyDataADA.csv. The file should be in your
local directory:

If you explored the data, it is easy to distinguish unnecessary values or columns
which need to be properly adjusted. This brings us to the next stage.
